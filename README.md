# FadeCandyS

FadeCandyS, which stands for FadeCandy Slim, is a modified version of the original [FadeCandy](https://github.com/scanlime/fadecandy) by scanlime. It's designed to be the same width as an [Adafruit NeoPixel Stick](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1426) and can be directly soldered onto the back of the NeoPixel Stick. It only uses has one pin instead of the 8 pins on the original FadeCandy, thus is only capable of controlling 64LEDs maximum.
